# üçÖ PomodoroFlow - HARDEN_REPO v1.0 Audit

**Staff Mobile Engineer / DX Lead Assessment**
**Target: App-store-credible MVP with A- grade or better**

## Executive Summary

PomodoroFlow is a clean Pomodoro timer with solid mobile foundations but needs significant hardening to achieve app-store readiness. Current state shows good mobile-first thinking with proper permissions and notification setup, but lacks modern development practices, testing infrastructure, and accessibility compliance.
