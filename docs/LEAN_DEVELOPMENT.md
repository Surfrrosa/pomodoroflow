# 🎯 Lean Development Principles - PomodoroFlow

## Current Codebase: ~980 lines
**Target: Stay under 2,000 lines total (including tests)**

## Lean Philosophy

### ✅ What We Keep Minimal
- **Core Logic**: Single-purpose, focused timer functionality
- **Dependencies**: Only essential packages (already good at 13 deps)
- **UI Complexity**: Clean, simple interface without feature bloat
- **Configuration**: Zero-config approach (true to Pomodoro principle)

### 📏 Line Budget Guidelines

| Category | Current | Budget | Notes |
|----------|---------|--------|-------|
| **Core App Logic** | ~650 lines | 800 lines | Timer, state, components |
| **Testing Code** | ~210 lines | 600 lines | Comprehensive but focused tests |
| **Documentation** | ~50 lines | 200 lines | Essential docs only |
| **Build/Config** | ~120 lines | 200 lines | CI, TypeScript, Expo config |
| **Total Budget** | 980 lines | **1,800 lines** | Professional yet lean |

### 🚫 Anti-Patterns to Avoid
- **Feature Creep**: No themes, complex settings, or social features
- **Over-Engineering**: No complex state machines or unnecessary abstractions
- **Verbose Tests**: Focus on behavior, not implementation details
- **Documentation Bloat**: Essential info only, no tutorials

### ✅ Quality Additions (Worth the Lines)
- **TypeScript**: +~100 lines of types (better DX, fewer bugs)
- **Accessibility**: +~50 lines (moral/legal requirement)
- **Error Boundaries**: +~30 lines (production stability)
- **Performance Optimizations**: +~40 lines (user experience)

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase Targets
1. **Documentation**: +150 lines (lean, focused docs)
2. **TypeScript**: +100 lines (types only, no bloat)
3. **Testing**: +400 lines (comprehensive coverage)
4. **CI/CD**: +50 lines (essential automation)
5. **Accessibility**: +50 lines (compliance)

**Final Target: ~1,730 lines** (professional, app-store ready, still lean)

### Code Review Checklist
- [ ] Does this add essential value?
- [ ] Can this be done in fewer lines?
- [ ] Is this the simplest solution?
- [ ] Does this maintain the "radical simplicity" principle?
- [ ] Would a first-time user understand this immediately?

**Remember**: Every line should serve the core mission - **helping users focus better**.
